# Mohamad El-Husseini

I'm a technical founder with over 20 years of experience in building digital products. I started writing mIRC bots and Civ 2 mods back when social media was ICQ and AIM, and dial-up modems made screechy sounds.

I'm currently in charge of consumer and enterprise digital products at Obramax. My products help millions of customers build their dream homes and have made Obramax the fastest growing and most successful retailer in our segment.

I excel at building and leading top-performing agile product teams, remote and onsite, that deliver business results and delight customers.

I've worked with many stacks, but I have had great success with Elixir, Phoenix, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and modern JS frameworks.
